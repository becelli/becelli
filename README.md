## Hello from 🇧🇷!
I'm a software developer and computer science student focusing on learning the GNU/Linux 🐧 environment and programming in general. Already worked with TypeScript, Python, C, Rust 🦀 and concurrent/parallel programming. Currently exploring the web backend and the functional paradigm.
