Hi there! My name is Gustavo, and I'm a software developer and computer science student located in Brazil. I have a keen passion for learning, particularly when it comes to languages, both natural and programming ones. I have experience working with TypeScript, Python, C, and Rust ðŸ¦€ and I am constantly looking for opportunities to expand my skill set. My primary focus is on building robust, efficient, and secure software that can solve real-world problems, and I am always striving to improve my abilities to create high-quality code.
