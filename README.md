Hi there! I'm a software developer and computer science student from Brazil with a focus on learning the GNU/Linux üêß environment and programming in general. I have experience working with languages such as TypeScript, Python, C, and Rust ü¶Ä, and am currently exploring web backend development and the functional paradigm.

I have experience working with a variety of tools and technologies, including:

- [Prisma ORM](https://github.com/prisma/prisma): I have used this ORM to create [applications](https://github.com/salies/voxlog), perform CRUD operations, and run transactions (atomic queries).
- [Express.JS](https://github.com/expressjs/express): I have used TypeScript and a MVC architecture to create [APIs](https://github.com/salies/voxlog) using Express.JS.
- [Docker/Docker-Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose): I have used Docker Compose to deploy and coordinate services (database, web front-end, and backend API) and manage a home Linux server providing applications as web services.
- [Rustlang](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust): I have enjoyed working with Rust, particularly in optimizing a heavy and slow Python [image processing application](https://github.com/becelli/kayn) by porting critical logic to Rust and working with parallelism and concurrency.
- Anything at all. I am always eager to try new technologies and tools.  ~~By the way, i hope [Crystal](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal) works out.~~

Finally, I am working on projects including a Last.fm alternative called [Voxlog](https://github.com/salies/voxlog), and a [Computer Graphics tool](https://github.com/becelli/computer-graphics).
